![AddonSync](icon.png)

There have been several requests over the years for Kodi addons to be able to share their configuration across different installations.

Enter a new Kodi service addon: "AddonSync". This addon allows you to set one of your Kodi installations as the "Master" and have it maintain a private addon settings "repository" in some shared network folder of your choosing, and all the other Kodi installations you have can install this addon as "Slaves" that will download and update the settings for all addons from those the Master has shared every time Kodi starts.

Please feel free to post any comments.
